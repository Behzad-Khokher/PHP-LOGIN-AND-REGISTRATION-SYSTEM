# PHP-LOGIN-AND-REGISTRATION-SYSTEM
Portfolio PHP Project

This is a portfolio PHP project to showcase my skill set in building a secure login and registration system.


Some Security Updates To include:
1. mysql_real_escape_string was deprecated in PHP 5. -> switch over to PDO
2. Use BCrypt for encryption instead of MD5. 
3. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection 
4. Using captcha to stop bots.
